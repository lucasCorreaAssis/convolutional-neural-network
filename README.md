# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository has the purpose of showing my lerning strategy for convolutional neural networks. 

## Convolution

The first step was to really understand convolution operation, which was easiear to understand in a simple one dimensional function, but the problem is when dealing with images we are talking about matrices, which has two dimensions, so naturally the next step was to learn two dimensional convolution.

## CNN's Layers

A CNN has multiple types of layers:
* Convolutional Layers
* Pooling
* Batch normalization

My strategy was to implement a simple version of each layer seperately and afterwards build a simple block with all of them.

## CNN Training

There are multiple strategies for training a CNN, in this repository I approach three of them:
* From scratch
* Features extraction
* Fine tunning
