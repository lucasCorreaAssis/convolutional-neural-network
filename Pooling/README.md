# Pooling

## Subsampling in CNNs

* Representative subset from the original data

* Reduces computational power required to precess the data

* Less parameters

* Reduces probability of overfitting


## hierarchical learning

* Low level
    * borders
    * small characteristics

* Medium level
    * shapes

* high level
    * specific characteristics

## MaxPool2D

Get the maximum value of a defined view field, reducing the resolution of the data.
